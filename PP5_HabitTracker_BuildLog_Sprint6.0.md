### 📅 Date: 2025-07-29  
### 📁 File: `PP5_HabitTracker_BuildLog_Sprint6.0.md`

### ✅ Features Implemented

#### 1. `EditHabitForm.js` – Prefilled Modal Form
- Created a new modal component for editing habits.
- Accepts `habit` object as prop and pre-fills all fields:
  - title, description, goal_type, frequency, priority
- PATCHes `/habits/:id/` with updated values.
- Shows spinner while submitting.
- Displays validation errors for missing title or invalid frequency.
- Calls `onHabitUpdated(updatedHabit)` on success and closes modal.

#### 2. Updated `HabitCard.js`
- Added “Edit” button to each card.
- Tracks `showEdit` modal state locally.
- Renders `EditHabitForm` modal when triggered.
- Passes habit props as initial form state.
- Passes `onHabitUpdated()` up to parent on success.

#### 3. Updated `HabitGrid.js` + `DashboardPage.js`
- `HabitGrid` now accepts `onHabitUpdate` prop.
- Passed to each card → bubbles updated habit back.
- `DashboardPage`:
  - Added `handleHabitUpdate()` to update habit in state.
  - Injects updated habit into local state using `map()`.

### 🧹 Cleanup & Refactoring

- Renamed edit modal to `EditHabitForm.js` (non-Django style).
- Reused `AddHabitModal` layout and validation patterns.
